This project aims to build a convolutional neural network for multiclass image classification from scratch using numpy. Broadly, this is an extension of my [previous project](https://github.com/iliatarasov/multilayer-perceptron-on-MNIST-with-numpy) and consequently I tried  making up for the general shortcomings of my previous neural net in addition to moving up from MLP to CNN. 

Outline:
- I first describe the network
- Then I take the dataset from the [Digit Recognizer Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) to train my CNN
- After that I make a prediction on the test data and submit it for evaluation
- Finally, I discuss the problems I faced during creation of this network and whether I was able to improve compared to the previous project

This notebook uses my network as a module, the source code for which can be found in the corresponding folder.
